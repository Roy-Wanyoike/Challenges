## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### Continued development

I feel like i can work on making my css less verbose and adopt more CSS3 syntax.


### Useful resources

- [ChartJS Tutorial Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ChartJS-tutorials) - The ChartJS tutorial youtube channel was very useful when it came to styling the chart.
- [ChartJS Documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - The ChartJS documentation also came in handy.
